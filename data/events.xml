                The project work constitutes a major component in most of the professional programmers. In this
                event project should be related to the field of Computer science / Information Technology.
                Participants of this event are expected to demonstrate some real life project. These projects can be
                carried out in some industry, research and development laboratories, educational institutions or
                software companies by the participant.
                It is suggested that the project is to be chosen which should have some direct relevance in day-to-day
                activities.
                Participants have to show the actual working of their project. Judging will be done on the basis of
                clarity of demonstration, effectiveness of the project and uniqueness of your idea.

            <discription>It is a treasure hunt type of competition, but the twist lies in the clues. The clues will be
                given in the form of code. Each team will have to crack the code leading them to another clue. Here the
                basic knowledge of C programming languages will be put to test.
